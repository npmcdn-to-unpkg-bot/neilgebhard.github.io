        <h3><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/equal-sides-of-an-array/train/javascript">Equal Sides of an Array</a></h3>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.</p>
        <h4>For example:</h4>
        <p>
            <div>Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:</div>
            <div>Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>Let's look at another one.</div>
            <div>You are given the array {1,100,50,-51,1,1}:</div>
            <div>Your function will return the index 1, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({50,-51,1,1}) both equal 1.</div>
        </p>
        <p>Note: Please remember that in most programming/scripting languages the index of an array starts at 0.</p>
        <h4>Input:</h4>
        <p>An integer array of length 0 < arr < 1000. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.</p>
        <h4>Output:</h4>
        <p>The lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return -1.</p>
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/bit-counting/train/javascript">Bit Counting</a></h3>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>Write a function that takes an (unsigned) integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number.</p>
        <p>Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/greed-is-good/train/javascript">Greed is Good</a></h3>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>Greed is a dice game played with five six-sided dice. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to score a throw according to these rules. You will always be given an array with five six-sided dice values.</p>
        <p>A single die can only be counted once in each roll. For example, a "5" can only count as part of a triplet (contributing to the 500 points) or as a single 50 points, but not both in the same roll.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/does-my-number-look-big-in-this/train/javascript">Does my number look big in this?</a></h3>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>A Narcissistic Number is a number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits.</p>
        <p>For example, take 153 (3 digits):</p>
        <p>1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153</p>
        <p>and 1634 (4 digits):</p>
        <p>1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634</p>
        <p>The Challenge:</p>
        <p>Your code must return true or false depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number.</p>
        <p>Error checking for text strings or other invalid inputs is not required, only valid integers will be passed into the function.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-digits-slash-digital-root/train/javascript">Sum of Digits / Digital Root</a></h3>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has two digits, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.</p>

        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.</p>
        <p>We will consider a, e, i, o, and u as vowels for this Kata.</p>

        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>Your goal in this kata is to implement an difference function, which subtracts one list from another.</p>
        <p>difference([1,2],[1]) == [2]</p>
        <p>If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:</p>
        <p>difference([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]</p>

        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>Find the length of the longest substring in the given string s that is the same in reverse.</p>
        <p>As an example, if the input was “I like racecars that go fast”, the substring (racecar) length would be 7.</p>
        <p>If the length of the input string is 0, return value must be 0.</p>
